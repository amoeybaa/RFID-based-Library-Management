# Bibliotheca â€“ RFID-Based Library Management System

## Features
* RFID-based member and book tracking
* Real-time book issuance and return system
* Online portal for searching books and managing accounts
* Admin panel for managing books and members
* Detailed transaction history and feedback module (to be implemented)
* Password reset and validation system
* Integration of hardware (RFID reader and RFID tags) with backend

## Technology Stack
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: PHP, Python
* **Database**: MySQL (can be modified to fit PSQL)
* **Hardware**: EM-18 RFID Reader, EM4102 RFID Tags (can use any reader as long as it transmits serial data)

## System Architecture

* **RFID Scanner Module**  
  Detects member and book tags using EM-18 reader connected to UART to serial convertor and sends serial data to the backend.

* **Web Application**  
  Handles member login, book search, issue/return requests, and admin operations.

* **Database**  
  Stores all user, book, author, and transaction data in normalized relational tables.

## How to Set Up
* **Backend**
  * Run the `app.py` program.
  * Start the MySQL server if using MySQL or update the code to fit any other database server.
  * Run the `db.sql` file on the database server.
 
* **Frontend**
  * For a member, the `Page/homepage.html` is the starting point.
  * For issuing/returning books, the `Main/main.html` is the starting point, which should ideally be constantly running one a screen in the library.
  * All passwords for the members and the admin are provided in the database.
 
## How to Use
* **Issue or Return a Book**
  * Scan the member's RFID tag.
  * Scan the book's RFID tag.
  * System checks borrowing limits, availability, and logs the transaction.
 
* **Online Portal**
  * Members can search for books, view borrowing history, and update their profile.
  * Admins can add, update, or delete books and members.
